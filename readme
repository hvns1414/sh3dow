# Sh3d0w

**Sh3d0w** is a Python tool that allows you to:

- Open Tor browser (using your `migta` Firefox profile)
- Encrypt files and folders (with automatic hash creation)
- Decrypt files (with hash verification)
- Delete original files after encryption

## Installation

### Windows
1. Open `install.bat` to install required Python packages (`cryptography` and `selenium`).

### Linux / macOS
1. Open terminal and run:
```bash
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
Usage
1. Open Tor browser
bash

python sh3d0w.py -r
2. Encrypt a file
bash
Kodu kopyala
python sh3d0w.py -s "path/to/file.txt"
3. Encrypt a folder
bash

python sh3d0w.py -s "path/to/folder"
4. Decrypt a file
bash

python sh3d0w.py -s file.txt.enc -d -k <ENCRYPTION_KEY>
Important: Save the encryption key when encrypting, you will need it to decrypt.

Notes
Make sure Python 3.x is installed and added to your PATH.

Tor must be running on 127.0.0.1:9050 for the Tor browser feature to work.


The original files are deleted after encryption for security
